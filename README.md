# jQuery Intro Lectures

The lecture itself is broken into four parts:

1. Introduction
  1. `JQ`: What is jQuery? Libraries, minified files, etc.
2. Selectors
  2. `JQ-SEL`: How to select elements with jQuery, basic usage, DOM traversal
3. Forms
  3. `JQ-FRM`:Form submission event handling and appending to the DOM
4. Events
  4. `JQ-EVT`:More elaborate event handling with .on() and dynamic elements

# In this Repo

This codebase has three parts that are used in the introduction to jQuery lecture.

## Selectors: `JQ-SEL`

The selectors dir contains code for introducing jQuery, DOM/DOM loading, etc. It also contains examples of the various kinds of selectors to cover. Comment/uncomment the lines to demonstrate their usage.

## Forms: `JQ-FRM`

The forms dir contains supporting code to covering HTML forms and input types as well as how to handle forms with jQuery. This contains sample code for handling the form and appending the submitted data to the DOM.

## Events: `JQ-EVT`

The events dir contains an example of an app that responds to various events and demonstrates appending to the DOM. Used for supporting the discussion of events, event handling, .on(), and the like.
